    <h1><b>GRiZ - <i>Rainbow Brain</i></b></h1><br>

    <p>&emsp;GRiZ is giving us a mind-bending 23 track album called Rainbow Brain. Inside, You have songs consisting of GRiZ’s 
       juicy saxophone and funky dubstep drum grooves. There are also featured artists like Big Gigantic & ProbCause in 
       ‘Daily Routine‘, Jantsen in ‘Burn Up the Floor‘, and Cherub in ‘Gold‘. We can’t forget GRiZ’s favorite vocalist and good friend 
       Chrishira Perrier too, holding the line on 2 of the new bangers. <br><br>
       
       &emsp;These 23 new tracks don’t stray too far away from GRiZ’s norm 
       but they pack a new punch. A punch that festivals across the country are not ready for. GRiZ is known for releasing tracks that 
       make their way into every single DJ set at every festival for only the best reasons.
