    <h1><b>TVBOO - <i>Songs Your Wife Leaves You To</i></b></h1><br>

    <p>&emsp;Making music for me has always been a reflection on what's going on around me, the interactions I have with people, 
        and the music that I'm introduced to. When that's taken away, I'm just left with just my goofy thoughts and ideas. That's where 
        this album came from. <br><br>
        
        &emsp;I wanted to make an album that pushes me not only as a songwriter/producer, but as a comedian too. I 
        wanted to make songs that we're undeniably good that you forget you're listening to a comedic record. All of these songs come 
        from real life experiences, and are stories I've never been able to fully express in my typical electronic songs. Music is fun, 
        fun is freedom, freedom is doing whatever the hell you want. These are songs your wife leaves you to.<br><br>
