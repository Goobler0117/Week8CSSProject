    <h1><b>Bonobo - <i>Fragments</i></b></h1><br>

    <p>&emsp; Fragments is the most emotionally intense record Bonobo has ever had to make. It’s no surprise that it’s also his masterpiece. 
       Fragments is a series of 12 sonic affirmations, featuring some of the hardest and most hip-shaking grooves that Simon Green, the
       man behind Bonobo, has ever created. Born first out of fragments of ideas and experimentation, the album ultimately was fused 
       together in a burst of creativity fueled by both collaboration and Green’s escape into the wild.<br><br>

       &emsp; It's about the dancefloor in many ways, about how “I remembered all over again how much I loved crowds and movement and people 
       connecting with each other,” Green reflects. But the positivity isn’t just in the uptempo rhythms: even the most introspective 
       and melancholic pieces have joy in them.<br><br>
